# Personal-Portfolio
This is a responsive multi-page website created as part of a frontend learning roadmap.
The project demonstrates the use of semantic HTML for structure and CSS for styling and layout.

The site includes multiple pages (Home, About, Projects, Contact) connected through a navigation bar.
CSS techniques such as Flexbox, media queries, and the box model are used to create a clean and responsive layout.
A contact form is included to practice form structure and styling.
